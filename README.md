## Overwiew
SINGULARITY is a space exploration rogue-like where you visit universes to find gold, explore planets and avoid dangerous hazards. Will you be able to escape the singularity?

## Features
- Randomly generated universes
- An interesting story to uncover
- Different planet variations
- Various hazards
- That FTL feeling of not knowing how the game is gonna kill you this time

## Roadmap
Since this is a project I work on as a hobby, I don't really have a time table for when to expect certain features to be finished. However, this is the list of features I want to implement (probably not in this order):
- [ ] More planet variations
- [ ] Updated graphics
- [ ] A remastered soundtrack
- [ ] Balancing
- [ ] General bugfixing
